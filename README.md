# slabV

A 36 key MX keyboard based on the [Horizon](https://github.com/skarrmann/horizon)

Rather than building up a case of sorts with only PCB's the slabV 
uses the same ideas of tightly formed cutouts from the horizon but
with silicone gaskets and acrylic.  It also adds layers between the PCB and the switch tops, also with more gaskets, to produce an
almost completely solid assembly with every mechanical junction
between layers damped with a gasket.

You can see in the image above there is the PCB, with a gasket +
acrylic layer below, and two more acrylic layers with gaskets above.

Here's an image of the bottom gasket + acrylic (still with the
protective cover).  These two examples are defective, but they 
show the combination of the extra kicad footprints from the
horizon used to cut specific clearance for the underside layers.

This whole stack produces a very solid and pleasingly dampened 
sound which could be described as Thocky if one was so disposed!
It's also about as low profile as can be with full size MX switches.
